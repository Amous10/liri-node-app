# LIRI Bot

## LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


#### This bash-terminal app can take in one of the following commands:

**concert-this** (to search upcoming concerts by artist(s) via *Bands in Town* api)
    enter: node liri.js concert-this <artist name here>

**spotify-this-song** (to search details of song titles via *Spotify* api)
    enter: node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'

**movie-this** (to search details of movies via the *OMDB* api)
    enter: node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'

**do-what-it-says**
    enter: node liri.js do-what-it-says (for a random search of concert, movie, or song)
